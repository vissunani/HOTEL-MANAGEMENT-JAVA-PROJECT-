The theme of my Project is Hotel Management System. This Project is a fine thought to make the
complex procedure of the Hotel management system to an easy manner which is systematic,
modular designed, selective menu based user display. The modular design and constructed
system is very much user oriented in which user can easily understand the tools and can do edit
of his own choice. The system is not any tough more and does not possesses many applications
but it is made by focusing on the maintaining records employee’s actions in a computerized
system rather than time taking and cumbersome manual system. The Purpose of the whole
process is to ease the daily or regular activities of the Hotel Management into an automatic
computerized retrievable process. The daily activities includes the Room activities, Entering
details of the new customer check in, To allocate a room as per the customer need and interest,
Recording the checkout time and details, Releasing or Empty of room and to record the process
in a computer system for future.
The application of the Hotel Management System bears the following functions to use by the
Administrator.
➢ Room status

➢ Allocation of Room as per the Customer Interest
➢ Statement of client Details
